## Abstract
Text Summarization can be a powerful tool to reduce the amount of time for reading documents, articles or even research papers. The thesis is divided into a larger state of the
art part and a shorter prototype part. The state of the art part examines the concepts of
text generation and text summarization with the focus on my prototype. Most concepts are
introduced in order to fully understand how my prototype is able to achieve the text generation, except for some advanced thinking outside the box concepts, which cannot be applied
by me, because it would exceed this thesis. My prototype is trained on the Amazon-finefood-reviews from www.kaggle.com and the results are evaluated on the Rouge and BLEU
scores. In the end, I further introduce some performance enhancements.
