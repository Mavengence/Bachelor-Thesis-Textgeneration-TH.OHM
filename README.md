## Abstract
As our final project we set up a remote control car with a raspberry Pi to drive autonomously


## Content

- [Donkeycar](https://github.com/Mavengence/Autonomous-RCCar-IT-Project-TH.OHM/tree/master/donkeycar) Repository
- [Car](https://github.com/Mavengence/Autonomous-RCCar-IT-Project-TH.OHM/tree/master/mycar) Repository

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, to get our Notebooks, Presentation and Project Report.

```
git clone https://github.com/Mavengence/Autonomous-RCCar-IT-Project-TH.OHM.git
```

### Prerequisites

- Of course you need git to get the source
- If you want to compile the report or the presentation by ur self u need a LaTex Compiler for your OS and maybe an IDE which makes things easier
- If you want to compile, train and play with our Code you need a python working environment. We used Jupyter Notebooks. The requiered packeges you can see in the Notebooks itself.
