	abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine
	translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural
	machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be
	jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed
	recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of
	encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into
	a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this
	paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in
	improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and
	propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for
	parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,
	without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new
	approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing
	state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French
	translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the
	(soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

In this paper, we describe our recent experiences of implementing an NL G component of a larger question-answering system, and trying to understand and resolve some of these problems in this context. We examine the whole lifetime of an answer, from internal data structure to final expression as text, and look for characteristics of the processing which might help identify where NL G really begins. On the basis of this analysis we propose some principles to inform discussions on the scope of NL G as an individuated enterprise.",

	abstract = "Neural sequence-to-sequence models have provided a viable new approach for abstractive text summarization (meaning they are not restricted to simply selecting and rearranging passages from the original text). However, these models have two shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual details inaccurately, and they tend to repeat themselves. In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task, outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points.",
